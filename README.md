# Pull Box


## Description
The Pull Box is a webapp designed for the Heroes and Hobbies comic shop to make the process of ordering books easier for our customers. Pull or stash boxes are common in comic book stores as customers tell shops which book series they wish to follow and the shop in turn orders those books for their box so that a copy is ready and waiting for each interested customer on release day. This app presents all the available books to the customers and allows them to choose which series or individual books they wish to pull, including cover variants and incentive copies. On ordering day, the shop can then export the total of all customers' pulls and simply upload it to the distributor, simplifying what would otherwise be a tedious manual process. Other shop information is available to the customer, such as the price totals, shop hours and contact info, and notification messages from the shop.

Pull Box was built as a project to learn React frontend development as part of the [Get Coding](https://www.getcoding.ca/) program, in addition to providing an app for Heroes and Hobbies. The project was built with React, Less/CSS, and uses ExcelJS to handle Excel files from the distributor.

## How to Use Pull Box
As a customer, using Pull Box is as simple as finding books you wish to purchase and pressing the pull button. You can search by name or browse by a number of criteria to find interesting books. The shop staff must upload the files available from the distributor to provide the app with the information on which book is available, which is then presented to all the users. The shop may also edit, shop info, and pricing info such as the conversion rate (from USD) and tax rates such that price totals are calculated accurately.
